# Contributing to Giant AI

We welcome contributions to Giant AI! This document outlines the process for contributing to the project and helps ensure that contributions can be incorporated effectively.

## üéØ Contributing Philosophy

Giant AI aims to be the premier open-source AI development toolkit. We encourage contributions that:

- **Enhance semantic understanding** - Improve RAG, MCP, or context management
- **Add specialized tools** - RAG-integrated utilities that provide unique value
- **Improve developer experience** - Better documentation, clearer workflows
- **Expand compatibility** - Support for new LLM providers, editors, frameworks

## üìã Contribution Process

### 1. Before You Start

**For significant changes:**
- Open an issue to discuss your idea before implementing
- Check existing issues and PRs to avoid duplication
- Review our [roadmap](docs/) to align with project direction

**For small fixes:**
- Feel free to submit PRs directly for bug fixes, typos, small improvements

### 2. Setting Up Development Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository

./scripts/ai-setup

# Test your setup
ai-rag index . --clear
ai-search "test query" . 3
```

### 3. Making Changes

```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes following the project conventions
# (See .giant-ai/conventions.yml for coding standards)

# Test your changes
./scripts/test-all.sh  # If available, or manual testing

# Commit with clear messages
git commit -m "Add semantic refactoring tool for pattern consistency"
```

### 4. Submitting Your Contribution

```bash
# Push your branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create a Pull Request on GitHub
