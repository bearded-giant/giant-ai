## Feature Implementation Process

### 1. Requirements Analysis
- Clearly understand what the feature should do
- Identify user-facing and technical requirements
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios

### 2. Design Approach
- Plan the architecture for this feature
- Identify which files need to be created or modified
- Consider how this integrates with existing code

### 3. Implementation Steps
- Create necessary files and directories
- Implement core functionality first
- Add error handling and validation
- Create or update tests
- Update documentation if needed

### 4. Integration
- Ensure the feature works with existing functionality
- Update any configuration files if needed
- Add necessary imports and exports

### 5. Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for new functions
- Add integration tests if applicable
- Manually test the feature flow

### 6. Code Quality
- Follow project naming conventions
- Maintain consistent code style
- Add appropriate comments for complex logic
- Ensure no linting errors

## Deliverables
- Working implementation of the feature
- Tests covering the new functionality
- Updated documentation (if applicable)
- Clear summary of all changes

Remember: Focus on clean, maintainable code that follows project patterns.
