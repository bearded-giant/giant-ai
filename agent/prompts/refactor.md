## Refactoring Guidelines

### 1. Analysis Phase
- Understand the current implementation
- Identify code smells and improvement opportunities
- Ensure you understand the existing functionality
- Check for existing tests

### 2. Refactoring Strategy
- Plan incremental changes
- Maintain backward compatibility unless specified
- Focus on one aspect at a time (e.g., structure, naming, patterns)

### 3. Safe Refactoring Steps
- Make small, testable changes
- Run tests after each significant change
- Preserve all existing functionality
- Improve code readability and maintainability

### 4. Common Refactoring Patterns
- Extract methods for repeated code
- Simplify complex conditionals
- Remove dead code
- Improve naming for clarity
- Reduce coupling between components
- Apply SOLID principles where appropriate

### 5. Verification
- Ensure all tests still pass
- Verify no functionality has been broken
- Check performance hasn't degraded
- Confirm code follows project conventions

## Important Constraints
- Do NOT change external APIs unless specified
- Maintain all existing functionality
- Keep changes focused and purposeful
- Document any significant architectural changes

## Summary Requirements
- List all files modified
- Explain the refactoring approach taken
- Note any improvements in code quality metrics
- Highlight any potential risks or breaking changes
