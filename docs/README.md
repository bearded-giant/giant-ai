# Giant AI Documentation

Welcome to the Giant AI documentation! This directory contains comprehensive guides for understanding and using Giant AI's features.

## Getting Started

**New to Giant AI?** Start here:

1. **[Quick Start Commands Guide](quick-start-commands.md)** - **ESSENTIAL**: Where to run what commands when - eliminates confusion!
2. **[Neovim Plugin](https://github.com/bearded-giant/giant-ai.nvim)** - Official Neovim integration for semantic search and AI analysis
3. **[LLM Connectivity Guide](llm-connectivity-guide.md)** - How Giant AI connects to your AI provider (Claude, OpenAI, etc.)
4. **[RAG + AI Analysis Workflow](rag-ai-analysis-workflow.md)** - Making RAG search results actionable with AI analysis
5. **[RAG vs Grep Usage Guide](rag-search-usage-guide.md)** - When semantic search provides value over traditional text search
