PROMPT="Please analyze these semantic search results from my codebase:

**Search Query**: $QUERY
**Project**: $PROJECT_PATH

$SEARCH_RESULTS

**Analysis Request:**
Based on these search results, please:
1. Summarize what patterns/approaches were found
2. Analyze the consistency and quality of implementations
3. Identify any gaps, inconsistencies, or improvement opportunities  
4. Recommend best practices based on what you see
5. Highlight the most relevant/useful code sections

Focus on practical insights that would help me understand and work with this code."
